# Spam_Email_Classifier
A machine learning project to classify emails as spam or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project uses Naive Bayes classification, TF-IDF vectorization, and NLTK for text preprocessing. The model is trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam emails and is then able to predict whether a new email is spam or not.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-classifier.git
Navigate into the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd spam-email-classifier
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the spam classifier script. Here’s how you can use it:

bash
Copy code
python spam_classifier.py
You’ll be prompted to type an email. The classifier will then predict whether the email is spam or not based on the trained model.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for building the model.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and training the model.
Naive Bayes: Machine learning algorithm used for text classification.
TF-IDF: Technique for transforming the text data into numerical format.
NLTK: Natural Language Processing toolkit used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
